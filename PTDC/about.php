            The colonial past of Puducherry is hard to miss even by the casual walker 

on the promenade beach.
            There stands the statue of Francois Dupleix. Not too far away is one of 

Joan of Arc. It's a trip
            down France as one crosses symmetrically aligned streets in Puducherry.

            The Portuguese have been here, so have the Dutch, the Danes and the 

English. By the 18th century,
            this tiny fishing village had turned into a grand port city. The French 

first set foot here in 1670
            and left a part of them when their undisturbed rule finished in 1954. Not 

much has changed since.
            The history has become punctuated.Dutch and British trading companies also 

wanted trade with India. Wars raged among these European countries and spilled over 

into the Indian subcontinent. The Dutch captured Puducherry in 1693 but returned it to 

France by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1699.

            The air is filled with nostalgia and the present is living up to a heritage 

that speaks so much.
            A trip to Puducherry is like a journey in time with a vibrant present 

celebrating its interesting
            past; its history goes back to before Roman times, but factually started 

with the arrival of the French in
            1673, who founded the town and built it to its present form, during the two 

and a half century they
            occupied it.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Puducherry" is the French interpretation of the original name "Puducheri" 

meaning "new settlement".
            Many pilgrims have shared the town's hospitality on their way to the temple 

town of Rameshwaram,
            thus enriching its culture. 
        </p>

    <p>Puducherry previously called Pondicherry and commonly known to as ‘Pondy’ was 

under the French jurisdiction until
        1954 and some people here still speak French and English with French accents. 

Hotels, restaurants and
        ‘lifestyle’
        shops sell a charming image of the French-subcontinental artistic, magnified by 

Gallic inventive types whose
        residence has, in turn, drew Indian artists and designers. Wide highways, 

seafront stroll, French building,
        stunning
        beaches and places of religious significance make Pondicherry a stop worthy of 

being visited.
